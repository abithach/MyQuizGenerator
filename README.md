# Quiz Generator

## Introduction

Our project focuses on creating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) through machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. MCQs are commonly used in educational assessments to gauge students' grasp of specific subjects. Automating the MCQ generation process can help educators save time and effort, all while maintaining the quality and relevance of the questions.
